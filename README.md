# dotfiles

Some simple dotfiles I use on my linux systems. 

I keep them on this git repo to seamlessly move them from a installation to another.

## Usage
Once in a while I run the backup.sh in order to copy selected dotfiles inside the repo folder, commiting and pushing it.

On fresh installed systems I run install.sh in order to copy the dotfiles to home and other places.

## License

You can use as you please.
