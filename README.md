# dotfiles

Some simple dotfiles I will now try to use on my linux systems.

I'll keep core dotfiles on this git repo to preserve them.

## Usage
Once in a while I will run the `backup.sh` (maybe with a cron task) in order to copy the *selected* dotfiles.

On fresh installed systems I intend to run `install.sh` [TODO]  in order to copy the dotfiles to proper places.


## License
Despite being very simple scripts, you are allowed to copy and use them as you wish if they suit your needs.

You are not required to give any credits for this work.
